### This module explains sorting and merging algorithms

## Criteria for judging the complexity of sorting algorithms

- The number of comparisons is proportional to the number of elements in the input data, this decides time complexity.
- Ther number of swaps the sorting technice is performing
- Adaptive, if elements are in sorted order, take minimum time
- Stable, if there are duplicate elements, they must be preserved
- Extra memory, analyze if it requires extra space.

### Bubble Sort

- is adaptive and stable
- worst case complexity is O(n^2)
- best case complexity is O(1)
- No suited for linked list
- K passes returns largest 3

### Insertion Sort

- is adaptive and stable
- worst case complexity is O(n^2)
- best case complexity is O(n^2)
- suited for linked list
- K passes is not useful
